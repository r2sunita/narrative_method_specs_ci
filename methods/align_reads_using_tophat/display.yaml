    <p>This method allows aligning RNASeq reads to a genome using Tophat in order to identify exon-exon splice junctions using bowtie mapping program. 
</p>
   <p>This method takes a bowtie2 index object and sequencing read file and outputs a set of read alignments in SAM format. It also provides A UCSC BED track of junctions and UCSC BED tracks of insertions and deletions as output files.</p>
